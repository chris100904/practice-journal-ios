# practice-journal-ios

(WIP) This project is a minimalist music practice companion designed to enhance musicians' practice routines through  technology integration. The app aims to combine essential practice tools, including an integrated timer for session tracking and audio recording capabilities for performance review. Musicians can access and manage Spotify reference recordings directly within the app, creating a comprehensive library of interpretations for study. The platform facilitates detailed practice journaling, allowing users to document their progress and insights, while also providing tools to set and track practice goals through a structured todo system. Built with a modern tech stack including Swift/SwiftUI for iOS development, Node.js/Express for backend operations, MongoDB for data management, and the Spotify Web API for music integration, the app delivers a robust yet intuitive practice management solution. Weekly analytics help musicians visualize their progress and maintain consistent practice habits, making it an indispensable tool for serious musicians seeking to optimize their practice routines.
